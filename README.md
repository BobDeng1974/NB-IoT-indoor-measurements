# NB-IoT-indoor-measurements
To map an indoor position with a received signal power a setup of two LIDAR sensors on an Arduino and an antenna controlled by a TSMW (from Rohde &amp; Schwarz) is used to investigate NB-IoT indoor. The work is done in collaboration with DTU Photonics. The scripts is primarily in MATLAB. Please read the manual.pdf before using.
